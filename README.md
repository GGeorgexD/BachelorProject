Hello, my name is Cuntan George and this is the project that I made for my Bachelor's Degree.

This is a game I made in Unreal Engine, it does not have a name. :)

Main feature implemented so far:
1. All characters can attack, can receive damage and can die
2. All characters have a health bar and only the main character(Paladin) has also a stamina bar
3. The Paladin have a 3 attacks combo
4. If the Paladin kills the Boss(Mutant) wins the game
5. If the Paladin is defeated, you will receive a lose screen.
6. There is a healthpack that fully heals the Paladin.
7. The Mutant has 2 attacks that deals different damage.
8. All The Islands, bridges and the healthpack were made in Blender
